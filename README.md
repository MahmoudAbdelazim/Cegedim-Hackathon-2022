# Quarantine Finder
This is an application that was built during the (Cegedim)[https://www.cegedim.com/Pages/default.aspx] Hackathon Winter 2022.

It's basically a website that allows patients with Covid 19 to register and see what hospitals currently have empty beds for quarantine.
They can then apply to a hospital if the emergency level is high, or get proper guides if the emergency level is medium or low.

## Technology
The website is built using Java & Spring Boot for the back-end REST APIs, and with JavaScript & JQuery for the front-end.
